Many governments have launched a sensing project that involves a series of sensors placed around the city for capturing a massive amount of data including pedestrian, vehicle, temperature, and air quality. Here are some examples: the Array of Things (AoT) in Chicago, USA and S-DoT in Seoul, Korea. With the rapid development of the Internet-of-Things (IoTs), the do-it-yourself (DIY) technologies attempt to democratize these monitoring practices that may be the domain of expert scientists. Our target audience are individuals who want to learn how to build the urban DIY sensors. 1.2 Scope of this document This document demonstrates 1) how to build a smart sensor that detects pedestrians outdoors through WiFi sensing and 2) analyze the created data to produce meaningful insights. This includes: Getting WiFi data preprocessing WiFi data analysis 1.2.1 Why WiFi sensing? WiFi sensing technologies is one of them as a non-invasive tool for monitoring pedestrians outdoor via sensors that detect WiFi packets sent regularly by access points (APs) and WiFi-enabled devices. Most pedestrians today carry smart devices equipped with WiFi network interfaces, and each WiFi packet includes unique 48-bit addresses, known as Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, enabling a device to be tracked by multiple WiFi sensors. Many recent papers used the sensing technologies to identify pedestrian movement and behaviors123. Concept of WiFi sensing technologies Duives, D. C., van Oijen, T., &amp; Hoogendoorn, S. P. (2020).

Open the imager and format your SD card. Write the Raspberry Pi OS on your SD card. Please enable ssh and set username (pi) and password (raspberry) in the setting before the writing. Step 2: Connect the Pi on your laptop This enables your laptop to access and control your Pi via a network cable. We dont need to buy and use a screen, keyboard and mouse that can be attached to the Pi. Plug in your SD card on the Pi and connect the Pi on your laptop via a Ethernet cable. Step 2: Install the Raspbian on your SD card To manage your Raspberry Pi, you need to have a wired LAN or wireless LAN set up on your desktop. You can easily manage your Pi with remote control if your Pi is networked with your desktop. 3.1.1 You should choose one of the many ways to manage Raspberry Pi 1.

Here is the figure illustrating the metrics. Count: How many people are present? Location  Where is that person? Track  Where was the person before? Identity  Who is the person? Activities  What is the person doing? The following sections cover how to generate the metrics. 4.1 Count 4.2 Location 4.3 Track 4.4 Identify 4.5 Activities You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.
