Many governments have launched a sensing project that involves a series of sensors placed around the city for capturing a massive amount of data including pedestrian, vehicle, temperature, and air quality. Here are some examples: the Array of Things (AoT) in Chicago, USA and S-DoT in Seoul, Korea. With the rapid development of the Internet-of-Things (IoTs), the do-it-yourself (DIY) technologies attempt to democratize these monitoring practices that may be the domain of expert scientists. Our target audience are individuals who want to learn how to build the urban DIY sensors. 1.2 Scope of this document This document demonstrates 1) how to build a smart sensor that detects pedestrians outdoors through WiFi sensing and 2) analyze the created data to produce meaningful insights. This includes: Getting WiFi data preprocessing WiFi data analysis 1.2.1 Why WiFi sensing? WiFi sensing technologies is one of them as a non-invasive tool for monitoring pedestrians outdoor via sensors that detect WiFi packets sent regularly by access points (APs) and WiFi-enabled devices. Most pedestrians today carry smart devices equipped with WiFi network interfaces, and each WiFi packet includes unique 48-bit addresses, known as Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, enabling a device to be tracked by multiple WiFi sensors. Many recent papers used the sensing technologies to identify pedestrian movement and behaviors123. WiFi-sensing Duives, D. C., van Oijen, T., &amp; Hoogendoorn, S. P. (2020).

Sensor component A Raspberry Pi board to build the sensor We used Pi 3B/3B+ but you can do the same with a lower model A WiFi adapter to capture air WiFi packets A WiFi dongle should have a chipset supporting ‘monitoring mode’ This repo used a Ralink RT5370 chipset; please check your chipset supports this function You can use a built-in WiFi chipset, but it generates heat and consumes too much power The three adapters in the figure are intended to collect WiFi data on three WiFi channels (1, 6, and 11, respectively) These three non-overlapping channels would be the best choices while there are 13 channels available in the 2.4 GHz range for Wifi in Korea A portable power bank for sensors that cannot use the power plug 20000 mAh portable battery lasts approximately one-day in our setting A micro SD card of at least 16GB size Others A Pi camera can be attached A built-in Bluetooth adapter can be used to collect Bluetooth data 2.2 How to set up and control your Pi To manage your Raspberry Pi, you need to have a wired LAN or wireless LAN set up on your desktop. You can easily manage your Pi with remote control if your Pi is networked with your desktop. 2.2.1 You should choose one of the many ways to manage Raspberry Pi 1. Use There are several ways to manage the Raspberry Pi Format your SD card You can download the SD Formatter software Install the Raspbian on your SD card You can set up the OS using Raspberry Pi Imager I recommend the Raspberry Pi OS with desktop version if you’re a beginner a Getting the Operating System to install on the Pi In order to build a wifi probe catcher the following is required: "],["wifi-data-preprocessing.html", "Chapter 3 WiFi Data Preprocessing 3.1 Data description 3.2 Data cleaning 3.3 Data combining", " Chapter 3 WiFi Data Preprocessing Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book. 3.1 Data description 3.2 Data cleaning 3.3 Data combining "],["wifi-data-analysis.html", "Chapter 4 WiFi Data Analysis 4.1 Count 4.2 Location 4.3 Track 4.4 Identify 4.5 Activities", " Chapter 4 WiFi Data Analysis 4.1 Count 4.2 Location 4.3 Track 4.4 Identify 4.5 Activities You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter).
