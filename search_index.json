Sensor component A Raspberry Pi board to build the sensor We used Pi 3B/3B+ but you can do the same with a lower model A WiFi adapter to capture air WiFi packets A WiFi dongle should have a chipset supporting ‘monitoring mode’ This repo used a Ralink RT5370 chipset; please check your chipset supports this function You can use a built-in WiFi chipset, but it generates heat and consumes too much power The three adapters in the figure are intended to collect WiFi data on three WiFi channels (1, 6, and 11, respectively) These three non-overlapping channels would be the best choices while there are 13 channels available in the 2.4 GHz range for Wifi in Korea A portable power bank for sensors that cannot use the power plug 20000 mAh portable battery lasts approximately one-day in our setting A micro SD card of at least 16GB size Others A Pi camera can be attached A built-in Bluetooth adapter can be used to collect Bluetooth data 2.3 How to set up and control your Pi To manage your Raspberry Pi, you need to have a wired LAN or wireless LAN set up on your desktop. You can easily manage your Pi with remote control if your Pi is networked with your desktop. 2.3.1 You should choose one of the many ways to manage Raspberry Pi 1. Use There are several ways to manage the Raspberry Pi Format your SD card You can download the SD Formatter software Install the Raspbian on your SD card You can set up the OS using Raspberry Pi Imager I recommend the Raspberry Pi OS with desktop version if you’re a beginner a Getting the Operating System to install on the Pi In order to build a wifi probe catcher the following is required: "]]
