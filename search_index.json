Count  How many people are present? Location  Where is that person? Track  Where was the person before? Identity  Who is the person? Activities  What is the person doing? The following sections cover how to generate the metrics. 4.1 Preprocessing Filter 1: Removal of random MAC addresses Filter 2: Removal of non-mobile devices Filter 3: Removal of rarely detected devices 4.1.1 Data analysis 4.2 Count 4.3 Location 4.4 Track 4.5 Identify 4.6 Activities You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers. "]]

Write the Raspberry Pi OS on your SD card. Please enable ssh and set username (pi) and password (raspberry) in the setting before the writing. Step 2: Connect the Pi on your laptop This enables your laptop to access and control your Pi via a network cable. We dont need to buy and use a screen, keyboard and mouse that can be attached to the Pi. Plug in your SD card on the Pi and connect the Pi on your laptop via a Ethernet cable. Enable internet connection sharing option on your WiFI adapter. Find and remember the IP address of your Pi. 1) Press the window key button; 2) type in cmd, 3) type in arp -a, 4) search the IP address of Raspberry Pi by looking the first 6 characters of physical address MAC Address Lookup: MAC addresses of the all devices of Raspberry Pi Foundation start with B8:27:EB:xx:xx:xx or DC:A6:32:xx:xx:xx. Access your Pi by Putty by typing the IP address in the host name. Log in your Pi with the default setting (ID: pi, password: raspberry). Type ping 8.8.8.8 to see if your Pi can use the Internet. Step 3: Set up your Pi Update your Pi and packages: sudo apt-get update -y &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade -y Install packages we use: sudo apt-get install git python3-pip python3-dpkt python3-pcapy python3-schedule python3-picamera python3-dropbox libbluetooth-dev -y Set up camera by turning on interface Options - Legacy Camera sudo raspi-config Set up Dropbox on your Pi. Get your Dropbox access key first Create a app in the developer site of Dropbox here Select access more scopes: Move into Permissions and check more access Clone this script to the Raspberry Pi git clone https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader.git Move into the cloned folder: cd Dropbox-Uploader Give the dropbox_uploader.sh script: sudo chmod +x dropbox_uploader.sh Run the dropbox_uploader.sh script: ./dropbox_uploader.sh Copy and paste your app key and app secret Cope and paste of the terminal URL to your search engine and put your access code Step 4: Test and play your your Pi 3.1.0.1 pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ifconfig eth0: flags=4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 inet 192.168.137.145 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.137.255 inet6 fe80::3c5d:cba4:ae56:8b59 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x20&lt;link&gt; ether b8:27:eb:90:57:50 txqueuelen 1000 (Ethernet) RX packets 108 bytes 10615 (10.3 KiB) RX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0 TX packets 175 bytes 27112 (26.4 KiB) TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0 chmod +x dropbox_uploader.sh ./dropbox_uploader.sh sudo apt update sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf country=GB network={ ssid=&quot;juhyeon9087&quot; psk=&quot;juhyeon9087&quot; key_mgmt=WPA-PSK } Open a terminal window sudo apt install libbluetooth-dev -y git clone https://github.com/MS3FGX/Bluelog.git cd Bluelog make ./bluelog -vmfn "]]
