# WiFi Data Preprocessing
This is to understand the raw WiFi data collected and how to filter the raw data.

## Reading data
### Step 1: Bring your data from Pi {-}
1. Download [DB Browser for SQLlite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).

2. Bring your data via FileZlia
    - When you plug your sensor, `sudo systemctl stop wifi_monitor` I recommend to stop the automatical setting.

3. Open the data using the DB Browser for SQLlite

### Step 2: Read the data in R {-}

```{r, include = F}
#### Set up ####
rm(list = ls())
Packages <- c("tidytext", "keras", "tidyverse",
              "ggmap", "mAPols", "data.table", "RPresto",
              "DBI", "RSQLite", "lubridate", "tidyr",
              "stringr", "readxl", "reshape2", "ggplot2", 
              "OpenStreetMap", "XML", "rgdal", "knitr", "leaflet", "sf", "foreach",
              "igraph", "ggraph", "devtools")
lapply(Packages, require, character.only = TRUE)

Packages <- c("spdplyr", "dbplyr",  "dplyr")
lapply(Packages, require, character.only = TRUE)

options(java.parameters = "-Xmx8192m")
memory.limit() / 1024
memory.size()
options("scipen" = 100, "digits" = 4)
```

- Bring your data here
  - If you don't have the data, use [this](./static/file/wifi-1/wifi_2020-07-13HMS09_18_32.sqlite3)

```{r}
db_raw_1a <- setDT(
  dbGetQuery(dbConnect(SQLite(), dbname = "./static/file/wifi-1/wifi_2020-07-13HMS09_18_32.sqlite3"),
  "SELECT timestamp, type, subtype, strength, source_address, destination_address,
  access_point_name, access_point_address, sequence_number, channel, info
  FROM packets") %>% collect())

head(db_raw_1a, 3)
```

#### Data Description {-}
| Field name | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| timestamp | The time at which the packet detected at sensor |
| Type/subtype |	Type of packet |
| Strength | The strength of the received signal at sensor |
| Source address	| The MAC address of the device that creates the original message |
| Destination address	| The MAC address of the device that eventually receives the message |
| Access point address |	The MAC address of the device that involves delivering |
| Sequence number | - |
| Channel | Adapter set be to monitor |
| Info | raw |

- The info column, is segmented to each field by hex (raw) via `binascii.hexlify`. [Here](https://www.slideshare.net/frnsbrdvld/asscii-codes)

## Preprocessing data


### Step 1: Removal of random MAC addresses {-}
You can assess the random MAC address [here](https://community.cisco.com/t5/security-documents/random-mac-address-how-to-deal-with-it-using-ise/ta-p/4049321)

  - How much Random MAC addresses are included?

```{r}
RANDOMIZED_SECOND_ORDER <- c("2", "6", "a", "e")
```

### Step 2: Removal of non-mobile devices {-}
- Join the MAC Vendor for first 12-chracter of MAC address
- Extract `Samsung|Apple|Xiaomi|LG|Huawei|Microsoft|Sony|OnePlus|Google`

```{r}
MAC_VENDOR <- fread("https://macaddress.io/database/macaddress.io-db.csv") %>%
  select(oui, companyName) %>% mutate(MAC_FIRST6 = str_sub(tolower(oui), 1, 8)) %>%
  select(-oui) %>% 
  as.data.table()

```

### Step 3: Removal of rarely detected devices {-}
- Calculate the duration of device in your dataset
- Filter out the short duration
