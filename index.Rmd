# Introduction

## About this document
This document provides useful information for individuals who are interested in **urban sensing** with commercially available lower-cost sensors. Many governments have launched a sensing project that involves a series of sensors placed around the city for capturing a massive amount of data including pedestrian, vehicle, temperature, and air quality. Here are some examples: the [Array of Things (AoT) in Chicago, USA](https://arrayofthings.github.io/) and [S-DoT in Seoul, Korea](https://github.com/seoul-iotdata/S-DoT_SampleData). With the rapid development of the Internet-of-Things (IoTs), the do-it-yourself (DIY) technologies attempt to democratize these monitoring practices that may be the domain of expert scientists. Our target audience are individuals who want to learn **how to build the urban DIY sensors**.

## Scope of this document
This document demonstrates 1) **how to build a smart sensor** that detects pedestrians outdoors through WiFi sensing and 2) **analyze the created data** to produce meaningful insights. This includes: 

  - Getting
  - WiFi data preprocessing
  - WiFi data analysis
  
### Why WiFi sensing?
**WiFi sensing technologies** is one of them as a non-invasive tool for *monitoring pedestrians* outdoor via sensors that detect WiFi packets sent regularly by access points (APs) and WiFi-enabled devices. Most pedestrians today carry smart devices equipped with WiFi network interfaces, and each WiFi packet includes unique 48-bit addresses, known as Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, enabling a device to be tracked by multiple WiFi sensors. Many recent papers used the sensing technologies to identify pedestrian movement and behaviors[^1][^2][^3].
