# Introduction
## Our sensor
The sensor is a device that is designed to measure pedestrian behaviors. The following functions are available:

 - Detecting WiFi packets
 - Recording

### Hardware {-}
| Item                  | Function                           | Requirement                    |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Laptop and LAN cable  | To access and control your sensor  |                                |
| Raspberry Pi board    | To build your sensor               | Pi 3B/3B+ or a higher model Pi |
| WiFi adapter          | To capture WiFi packets            | Check your chipset that supports 'monitoring mode' [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/614984/supported-chipset-for-monitor-mode-and-packet-injection-in-kali-linux) |
| Micro SD card and adapter  | To build and store the data   | At least 16 GB size |
| Ethernet cable  | To connect the Pi with your laptop   | |
| Portable power bank | To run the sensor in outdoor environment | +20000 mAh battery </br> * It lasts one-day in our setting |
| Pi camera  | To record the scene in the front of sensor  |                      |

### Skill {-}
Learning R and Python will be necessary for sensor building and data analysis. I recommend these classes: [Data Science: Foundations using R Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r) and [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)
