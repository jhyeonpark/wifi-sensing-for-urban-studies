# How to build a sensor 


## What does the sensor do?





The sensor is a device that is designed to measure pedestrian behaviors. Here are 
This is the figure of Here is our sensor.

## Prerequisite
### Hardware
| Item                  | Function                           | Requirement                    |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Laptop and LAN cable  | To access and control your sensor  |                                |
| Raspberry Pi board    | To build your sensor               | Pi 3B/3B+ or a higher model Pi |
| WiFi adapter          | To capture WiFi packets            | Check your chipset that supports 'monitoring mode' [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/614984/supported-chipset-for-monitor-mode-and-packet-injection-in-kali-linux) |
| Micro SD card and adapter  | To build and store the data   | At least 16 GB size |
| Ethernet cable  | To connect the Pi with your laptop   | |
| Portable power bank | To run the sensor in outdoor environment | +20000 mAh battery </br> * It lasts one-day in our setting |
| Pi camera  | To record the scene in the front of sensor  |                      |


`r emo::ji("check")` **A laptop and lan cable** to control your sensor  
`r emo::ji("check")` **A Raspberry Pi** board to build your sensor  
`r emo::ji("check")` **A WiFi adapter** supporting 'monitoring mode'; please check your chipset [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/614984/supported-chipset-for-monitor-mode-and-packet-injection-in-kali-linux)  
`r emo::ji("check")` **A micro SD card** of at least 16GB size  
`r emo::ji("check")` **A portable power bank** for sensing in outdoor environment that is difficult to supply power  
  - 20000 mAh portable battery lasts approximately one-day in our setting

`r emo::ji("check")` **A Pi camera** if you want to record the scene in the front of sensor

### Skill
Learning R and Python will be necessary for sensor building and data analysis. I recommend these classes: [Data Science: Foundations using R Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r) and [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)
